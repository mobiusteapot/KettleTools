Developed for collaboration and communication within Building Virtual Worlds at the Entertainment Technology Center. Ideal for remote teams working on game jams.


Note - I'm planning on continuing to update this, but making a fork for use within BVW from this version, and keeping that on the UPM server would be ideal. I'll be updating here: https://github.com/mobiusteapot/KettleTools/tree/release

Feel free to mirror or fork any changes back in as you see fit.
